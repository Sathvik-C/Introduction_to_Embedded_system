# Coursera - Introduction to Embedded Systems Software and Development Environments
## University of Colorado Boulder

Contains my courseware for the [Introduction to Embedded Systems Software and Development Environments by University of Colorado Boulder taught on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-embedded-systems/home/welcome)

This class has taught me a fair bit and definitely made me brush off my embedded knowledge from school


### Week 1
Learn basics, write a C program to do statistical analysis, and compile code

### Week 2
Learn Makefiles and the build process.  Assignment was much harder for me as I am not fluent in Makefiles.  I had to find an online resource

### Week 3
Memory and memory locations.  Learn where and why different variables are stored where they are.  The assignment was **very** hard for me and I had to take it 7 times.  Due to that, I found the **solutions** online, and posted them along with my explinations in the [C1M3 subfolder readme](https://github.com/jtilles/coursera-introduction-embedded-systems-software-and-development-environments/blob/master/C1M3/readme.md).

### Final Assessment
Utilizes all previous knowledge and software from the course.  Covers:
* Stats.c (Week 1)
* Makefiles (Week 2)
* Memory Manipulation & Pointers (Week 3)
